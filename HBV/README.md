## Project purpose/description 

The project aims to implement a hydrological model for simulating river discharge based on various factors such as rainfall and snowfall,temperature,evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage.The project helps in understanding hydrological processes and their role in water resource management and flood forecasting. This model is important for understanding water flows and how it is stored in nature, which helps in managing water resources, anticipating how environmental changes will affect water systems, and making informed decisions in areas related to water use and conservation. 
***
## Motivation
Hydrological models play a vital role in water resources engineering by enabling the approximate simulation of river discharge, which is crucial for effective water supply management, hydraulic structure design, and flood risk mitigation. This project implements an HBV-based model to enhance the understanding of catchment hydrology and provide a computational framework for predicting river water flow using meteorological data

## Theory
The primary goal of this project is to calculate the river discharge resulting form the rainfall and snow melt according to temperature considering evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage. According to simple water balance equation

$$ P = Q + ET + \Delta S^{[3]} $$

Where,
* $P$- precipitation
* $Q$- runoff
* $ET$- Evapotranspiration
* $&#916;S$- change in soil moisture storage.

The HBV approach basically contains 3 modules.They are

#### 1. Snow Module

The model determines snow accumulation and melting based on temperature and precipitation. If the current temperature `T` is lower than the threshold temperature `TT`, precipitation accumulates as snow. If `T` exceeds `TT`, snowmelt occurs, calculated as:

$$ \text{liquid water} = C_{\text{melt}} \cdot (T - TT)^{[3]} $$

where,
   *  $C_{\text{melt}}$ - the coefficient that determines snow melt per degree of temperature


#### 2. Evapo Transpiration(ET) Module

Evapotranspiration (ET) refers to the combined process of water evaporation from the soil and transpiration from plants. To calculate ET, this project considered several factors including the  soil moisture , potential evapotranspiration ùíëet, and the permanent wilting point (ùíëùíòùíë). If the previous soil moisture is greater than the permanent wilting point, evapotranspiration occurs at its potential rate:

$$ ET_t = PE_t^{[3]} $$

However, if the soil moisture is less than or equal to the permanent wilting point, the actual evapotranspiration is proportional to the ratio of soil moisture to the wilting point and the potential evapotranspiration:

$$ ET_t = \frac{SM_{t-1}}{pwp} \cdot PE_t^{[3]} $$

This balance ensures that plants get the necessary water while accounting for soil moisture conditions.

#### 3. Soil Moisture Module

The soil moisture module tracks the dynamics of soil moisture and groundwater outflow. It uses previous soil moisture ($SM_{t-1}$), outflow from the snow module ($LW_t$), evapotranspiration ($ET_t$), field capacity ($FC$), and a coefficient ($\beta$).
   
i. Current Soil Moisture ($SM_t$):
* Current Soil Moisture ($SM_t$):
* Formula: 

$$ SM_t = \max(0.0, SM - 1 + LW_t \cdot \beta)^{[3]} $$



ii. Final Soil Moisture:
* Adjusted for outflow to groundwater and evapotranspiration.
* Formula:
  
$$ SM_t = \max(0, SM_{t-1} + LW_t \cdot (Q_{b,t} + ET_t))^{[3]} $$


#### 4. Runoff Calculation

The surface runoff ($Q$) is computed using the following formula:
 
$$ Q = k \cdot S^{[3]} $$


where: 
- **$Q$**- Surface runoff in mm/day
- **$k$**- a coefficient that representing the efficiency of converting soil moisture into runoff 
- **$S$**- Soil moisture storage

**2. log_config.py**

This file contains a function `setup_logger()` which,Sets up a logger to log messages to a specified log file with the given logging level.
This function creates a logger object with a file handler, sets the logging level,
and attaches a formatter to structure the log messages.This will create 3 logfiles such as actions.log,warnings.log,errors.log.These log files stores all
the logged messages.

#### main.py file Overview: Executing HBV Modeling
The main.py file accesses the `HBV_Core` package to execute the HBV hydrological modeling process.It has 3 functions.

1.`hbv_calculation()`-  This function is responsible for executing the entire runoff modeling process using the HBV hydrological model. It begins by initializing a `SoilMoisture` object with the provided CSV file, which contains the necessary hydrometeorological data. The function then sequentially processes the data by loading it, removing missing values, calculating snowmelt, simulating the necessary parameters and estimating runoff, and computing the discharge volume. The processed data is stored in the data_hbv attribute of the runoff object. If plotting is enabled, it generates visualizations to compare simulated and observed values as first plot, Precipitation and SoilMoisture values as second plot. Throughout the process, logging is used to track execution steps and handle any unexpected errors. Finally, the processed dataset is returned for further analysis.

2.`statistics(processed_data)`-This function looks at runoff data and calculates the average and standard deviation for key variables like precipitation, simulated discharge, and observed discharge. This helps to see how the model's results compare to actual data, making it easier to understand and improve the model.

3.`main()`-This function serves as the entry point for the runoff modeling process. It first calls `hbv_calculation()` to process hydrological data, including snowmelt, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and discharge volume calculations. Once the data is processed, it passes the results to the `statistics()` function, which analyzes key metrics like mean and standard deviation. This function ensures the complete execution of the model and statistical evaluation in a structured manner.
